# Global Agent Instructions: Using Ruby Mastery

If you are an AI agent (Cursor, Claude, Codex, etc.) working in this project, you have access to a global architectural tool called `ruby_mastery`. Use it to understand and monitor the codebase.

## Recommended Commands

### 1. Initial Architecture Assessment
Run this to understand the project's health and domain structure:
```bash
ruby_mastery architecture score .
```

### 2. High-Level AI Context
Run this to get a structural summary of the repository (useful for planning refactors):
```bash
ruby_mastery architect .
```

### 3. Visual Mapping
Generate a GraphViz DOT file to visualize dependencies:
```bash
ruby_mastery architecture graph .
```

### 4. Static Analysis
Check for Ruby idioms and architectural violations:
```bash
ruby_mastery analyze .
```

## When to use it:
- Use `architect` when you first enter a new project.
- Use `score` before and after major refactorings to ensure architectural health hasn't drifted.
- Use `analyze` to find specific code-level violations like long methods or fat controllers.
